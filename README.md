# Hello, Cloud: Terraform tutorial at OSCON 2017

These are the files we are using for our Terraform tutorial. While the class is meant to walk people through creating the resources on their own, these file are here for later reference or to help people catch up if they fall behind during the workshop.

When we have video, we'll post it.
